## Installation

It's recommended that you setup a virtualenv before development.

Setting django tailwind
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cahyoadhi/ngopikuy.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```


Then just install requirements, migrate, and runserver to get started:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cahyoadhi/ngopikuy.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
